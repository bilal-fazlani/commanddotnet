Here we've converted the arguments for Sum into an IEnumerable<int> and added a Range command.
You've probably noticed these commands wrap LINQ methods of the same name. 
We've added an optional sleep option to Range to better mimic a long running stream. 

We could have used List<int>, int[], or any other collection type. 
Using IEnumerable<T> allows the command to start processing before the stream has completed.

Very few console frameworks make it this easy to write streaming console tools.

Let's see it in action:

```bash
~
$ dotnet linq.dll Range 1 4 10000 | dotnet linq.dll Sum
1
3
6
10
```

After outputtting a value, Range sleeps for 10 seconds.  We know Sum is streaming because it immediatly outputs the new sum as soon as it receives a value and waits for the next value.
