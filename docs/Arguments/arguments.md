# Arguments

Arguments are defined as parameters of a method or properties of a class (see [Argument Models](argument-models.md))

As discussed in [Terminology](../argument-terminology.md), Option and Operand are the two concrete types of IArgument

* Option: named argument
* Operand: positional argument

By default, arguments are operands. Change the default by assigning `#!c# AppSettings.DefaultArgumentMode = ArgumentMode.Option`

Use the `[Operand]` (or `[Positional]`) and `[Option]` (or `[Named]`) attributes to explicity denote which argument type and to configure the arguments.

The Positional and Named attributes are provided for those who prefer that terminology for defining commands. The terms operand and option are still used for these arguments elsewhere in the framework.

!!!Tip
    See [Option vs Operand](option-or-operand.md) for recommendations on when to use one vs the other.

## Operand Attribute

The OperandAttribute has the following properties:

* __Name__: Used in help documentation only. Defaults to the parameter or property name.
* __Description__: Used in help documentation.

The PositionalAttribute is a subclass of OperandAttribute

## Option Attribute

The OptionAttribute has the following properties:

* __LongName__: Used in help documentation and on the command line. Defaults to the parameter or property name. 
    * Set to `null` to remove the default long name and have only a short name.
* __ShortName__: Used in help documentation and on the command line. Defaults to null.
* __Description__: Used in help documentation.
* __BooleanMode__: When the option is a `bool`, this determines if the presence of the option 
  indicates `true` (_Implicit_) or if the user must specify `true` or `false` (_Explicit_). 
    * The default is _Implicit_ and can be changed with `#!c# AppSettings.BooleanMode = BooleanMode.Explicit`
    * _Implicit_ boolean options are also called __Flags__
* __AssignToExecutableSubcommands__: only valid when used in [Interceptor](../Extensibility/interceptors.md) methods.

The NamedAttribute is a subclass of OptionAttribute, provided for those who prefer 

## Example

``` c#
public void LaunchRocket(
    [Operand(Name = "planet", 
        Description = "Name of the planet you wish the rocket to go")] 
    string planetName,
    [Option(LongName = "turbo", ShortName = "t", 
        Description = "Name of the planet you wish the rocket to go")] 
    bool turbo,
    [Option(ShortName="a",
         Description="Abort the launch before takeoff", 
         BooleanMode=BooleanMode.Explicit)]
    bool abort)
```

and help looks like:

```bash
Usage: dotnet CommandDotNet.Example.dll launch-rocket [options] [arguments]  
                                                                             
Arguments:                                                                   
                                                                             
  planet  <TEXT>                                                             
  Name of the planet you wish the rocket to go                               
                                                                             
Options:                                                                     
                                                                             
  -t | --turbo                                                               
  Name of the planet you wish the rocket to go                               
                                                                             
  -a      <BOOLEAN>                                                    
  Abort the launch before takeoff                                            
  Allowed values: true, false                                                
```

and called any of these ways:

```bash
dotnet example.dll LaunchRocket -t -a true mars
dotnet example.dll LaunchRocket --turbo -a true mars
dotnet example.dll LaunchRocket mars -t -a true
dotnet example.dll LaunchRocket mars --turbo -a true
```

Options are not positional so they can appear in any order within the command.

Configuring a ShortName nullifies the default long name 
so LongName must also be configured if you need both.

| Parameter name | Longname | Shortname | Generated template
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| turbo |  |  | `--turbo` |
| turbo | turbo |  | `--turbo` |
| turbo |  | t | `-t` |
| turbo | turbo | t | `-t | --turbo` |
| t |  |  | `-t` |

## Flags

Flags are boolean options with a default value of false. The presence of the flag indicates true. This simplifies the user experience by allowing them to specifiy `-b` instead of `-b true`.  This also enables clubbing.

Define them as Options with BooleanMode = BooleanMode.Implicit. Implicit is the default defined for `AppSettings.DefaultBooleanMode` or `OptionAttribute.BooleanMode`.

## Flag Clubbing

Clubbing (aka bundling) is when several flags are specified together using their short names. 

For example: `-abc` is the same as `-a -b -c`

Clubbing is only available for flags by short name.

## Option assignments

When assigning option values, the following are the same

* `--time tomorrow`
* `--time=tomorrow`
* `--time:tomorrow`
